# Introduction

Welcome! This is the page for documentation for the **Layer** swap tool.

**Layer** makes it easy to swap tokens on multiple dexes like Uniswap V2. **Layer** isn't meant to have the best gas price, but to be the assistor of liquidation of tokens. For example, your DeFi smart contract can swap the farmed tokens into other tokens easily on-chain. No setup needed.

For a higher-level howto, see the [Resources ](general/getting-started.md)page.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Layer** is meant to be used on-chain, as there are much better tools to swap tokens with off-chain tools \(like [Matcha](https://matcha.xyz/)\).
